# ⚠️ Project Archived

This repository has been archived.
Active development continues in a private repository.

As the sole contributor, I have relicensed the project from GPL-3 to a proprietary license.
To make development sustainable, the app now includes a premium tier while keeping core features - including substance information and basic logging - free.
Because of this partial monetization, future versions are closed-source to prevent redistribution of paid functionality.

You can still explore this repository to learn from its earlier open-source implementation, but it will not receive further updates or support.
