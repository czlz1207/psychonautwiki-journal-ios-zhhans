Such small quantities cannot be accurately measured with common digital scales, so the substance must instead be dosed volumetrically by weighing out larger amounts of the compound and dissolving it in a calculated volume of a suitable liquid.\n\nSearch the internet to determine what solvent to use.

Use distilled water instead.\nLook up the solubility of the substance you want to dissolve in water/ethanol to make sure it will dissolve fully. Most if not all common substances in their salt form are more than soluble enough.\nTo prevent degradation by temperature use ethanol or a water/ethanol mix as the solvent such that it can be put in the freezer without freezing. However don't use ethanol for nasal sprays as this can damage the nasal mucosa.\nPowders for nasal delivery have higher bioavailiability than liquids because of increased stability and residence time on nasal mucosa.";

If the amounts of the drug are smaller, use volumetric dosing (dissolving in water or alcohol to make it easier to measure).\n\nMany substances do not have linear dose-response curves, meaning that doubling the dose amount will cause a greater than double increase (and rapidly result in overwhelming, unpleasant, and potentially dangerous experiences), therefore doses should only be adjusted upward with slight increases (e.g. 1/4 to 1/2 of the previous dose).";

"faq_q1" = "Why is an interaction or other info on a substance present in the PsychonautWiki article but not in the app?";
"faq_a1" = "Either the info is not annotated correctly in the article, the PsychonautWiki API does not parse the info correctly or the app does not import the info from the API correctly. In any case please report the bug through the app.";
"faq_q2" = "When does the app show an interaction warning?";
"faq_a2" = "If there is an interaction with a substance that was logged less than 2 days ago or there is an interaction with any of the following: %@.";
"faq_q3" = "How can one change or add info on a substance (duration, dose, interactions and effects)?";
"faq_a3" = "By editing the corresponding PsychonautWiki article.";
"faq_q4" = "How often are substances updated?";
"faq_a4" = "On every new version of the app.";
"faq_q5" = "How is the timeline drawn?";
"faq_a5" = "The onset duration range from PsychonautWiki defines when the curve starts going up, the comeup how long it goes up for, the peak how long it stays up and the offset how long it takes to come down to baseline. The peak and offset durations are linearly interpolated based on the dose if possible, else it just chooses the middle value of the range. If some of the durations are missing it draws a dotted line. E.g. if the onset and total time is given it draws a line along the bottom for the onset and then it draws a dotted curve to the end of the total time.";
"faq_q6" = "Why does the timeline not cumulate the curves of different ingestions together?";
"faq_a6" = "One can not add two curves together because one ingestion might build up tolerance, influencing the curve of the other ingestion. The curve can only be drawn based on data that is available through PsychonautWiki.";
